# Sentiment Analysis using Support Vector Machine

In this project we have developed a flask application for sentiment analysis.
Download the code and run flaskapp.py from the main directory.

The model is trained and saved as pkl files. Along with that the stop words and vectors are also loaded in the falsk app.
